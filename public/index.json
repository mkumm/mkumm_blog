I work as an Elixir Developer for Simplebet. I have family (and a house) in Detroit, so I travel back often.\nWork # I love my job working as an Elixir Developer at Simplebet. I work with amazing people in a technology stack I love and I am still trying to master.\nIn prior iterations of my career I have worked in leadership (CTO, Operations Management, IT Director, Development Manager). I have been coding since before I graduated high school and I find something interesting in most languages I study! Professionally I have developed in C, PHP, Python, and Elixir with most of the web technologies that complement the languages. These days I look for inspiration in Rust, Haskell, Ocaml, Go, Gleam, and others.\nI have also been responsible for design projects and have come to enjoy the Adobe suite of products.\nHobbies and Interests # Photography # I am a hobbiest photographer, mostly using my Nikon z50 (a wonderful hobbiest camera great for portability).\nMusic Creation # I take a stab at some music creation with Ableton and played the violin through my first year of college. Here is my latest sample, one of the birds\nReading # I love reading fiction, non-fiction, and technical books. I get all my news from The Economist.\nCraft Beers # I love trying different beers and I get especially excited with cask ales.\nCoffee # I love brewing coffee and always seek out the best local roasters (there are some great ones in Krakow).\nPolish Language # I continue to struggle to learn Polish, but I take weekly lessons and study most days of the week.\nCooking # I enjoy cooking and find it more relaxing than watching TV.\nTravel # My partner and I do a lot of walking, at home and while traveling.\nChess # I have just started playing chess again. I don\u0026rsquo;t win a lot, but I do enjoy the game.\nresume\n","date":"2 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"mkumm.com","summary":"TL;DR; # I was born in suburb of Detroit and am living in Krakow, Poland.","title":"About Michael Kumm"},{"content":" A Cursed Bunny Indeed # ","date":"2 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/book-cursed-bunny/","section":"","summary":" A Cursed Bunny Indeed # ","title":"Cursed Bunny"},{"content":"","date":"2 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fiction/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fiction"},{"content":" A very good read # How to calm your mind\u0026hellip;\nThis is how you write a blog!\n","date":"2 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/book-how-to-calm-your-mind/","section":"","summary":"A very good read # How to calm your mind\u0026hellip;","title":"Book How to Calm Your Mind"},{"content":" This is a now page.
