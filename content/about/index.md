## tl;dr (too long; didn't read)

I was born in a suburb of Detroit and I am now living in Krakow, Poland. I work as an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) Developer for [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.ai/). I have family, friends, and a house in the Detroit area so I travel back to Michigan often.

## Current Work

My full time day job lets me work in Elixir for a company that supplies data to sports books; allowing them to offer in-game betting. I work with an amazingly supportive team with some of the brightest in the Elixir community. We work mainly in Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView, and Surface. I am starting to get more interested in Compilers and Site Reliability Engineering as well as continuing to master Elixir/Phoenix and the ecosystem.

## Previousl Work

My professional career has followed two simultaneous paths. One in technology and the other in business management and leadership and sometimes overlapping.

Professionally I have been lucky enough to create in C, PHP, Python, and Elixir. These days I play around in Lua, Rust, OCaml,
Go, (maybe soon Gleam), and others as well as the technologies supporting the current wave of AI.

In the past I have had several leadership roles as CTO, Operations Management, IT Director, Development Manager.

## Hobbies and Interests

### Photography

I a (very) amateur photographer and share some of my photos on [Instagram (@mkumm)](https://www.instagram.com/mkumm/)
and [Flickr.com (@mkumm)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkumm/). My main camera is my wonderfully portable [Nikon z50](https://imaging.nikon.com/imaging/lineup/mirrorless/z_50/). I know it falls in the non-professional category of photo hardware, but I am, well a non-professional.

### Music Creation

I played violin through my first year of college and then just stopped. I did nothing with music for about 30 years and then I started playing around with Ableton. I have been creating music as find time, here is a short sample of my latest - **One of the Birds**

### Software Development

Code has been with me since an early age and I have never strayed too far away. I am lucky that I get to develop software during work hours and then really go deep into compilers (or whatever else) during my non-work hours.

### Reading

I love reading
fiction, non-fiction, and technical books. For current events, The Economist.

### Craft Beers

I love tasting craft beers even if I my tolerance for drinking is going down. I am not above taking a long trip primarily to taste some new beers.

### Coffee

I love brewing coffee (maybe even more than drinking it) and I always seek out the best local roasters (there are some great ones in Krakow).

### Polish Language

I continue to struggle to learn Polish, but I take weekly lessons and study most days of the week.

### Cooking

I cook the vast majority of our meal. I enjoy it and find it more relaxing than watching TV and stuff like that.

### Travel

Been traveling a little less lately, but have some bigger trips planned later this year.

### Chess

I have just started playing
chess again. I don't win a lot, but I do enjoy the game.

## Tools

The following are my current tool choices to support my work and hobbies.

### Hardware

- **MacBook Pro M1 16-inch** My work supplied laptop.
- **MacBook Pro M1 16-inch** My dedicated personal laptop.
- **MacBook Air M3 13-inch** The perfect companion for remote work and travel.
- **Philips 27-inch PHL 276E8V** A super affordable second display.
- **Benq ScreenBar** One of the my best purchases. Not only providing spot lighting only where I want it, it also helps reduce eye strain (for reasons I don't understand).
- **iPhone 13 ProMax** More tha 2 years old and still works great for my purposes.
- **Nikkon z50** a really great camera body for walking around all day and taking photos. I have 2 lenses, the **Nikkor DX 16-50 3.5-6.3** and the **NIKKOR DX 24/1.7**

My main workhorse is a MacBook Pro M1. I have a dedicated machine each for work and personal. I also have a portable
