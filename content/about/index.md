## Currently Working as...

An Elixir developer at [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.ai/). I have been working in Elixir exclusively for nearly 4 years and there is still a lot to learn. At the moment I am going deeper into CQRS and RabbitMQ.

## Previously

I have had the opportunity to build experience in both software development and leadership management; enjoying both equally. I have had some great mentors over years and don't regret any of my positions.  

## Hobbies and Interests

### Photography

I am a (very) amateur photographer, all the photos on this site were taken by me. My main camera is my wonderfully portable [Nikon z50](https://imaging.nikon.com/imaging/lineup/mirrorless/z_50/).

### Music Creation

I did nothing with music for about 30 years and then I started playing around with Ableton. I have been experimenting with music composition as I find time, here is a short sample of my latest - **One of the Birds**

### Software Development

Yes, both as a day job and a hobby. 

### Reading

I am typically working through about 5 different books at any given time. I especially enjoy classic literature and non-fiction. 

### Craft Beers

I love tasting craft beers even if my tolerance for drinking is dropping with age. I am not above taking a long trip primarily to taste some new (or old) regional beers. 

### Coffee

I am not sure if I enjoy brewing coffee of drinking coffee more. At home I recently switched over to a Moka Pot and I am enjoying the different flavors and textures it produces. 

### Polish Language

Still working on learning this hard-for-me language. I have a patient teacher and an inpatient partner, the combination is working pretty well. 

### Cooking

I find cooking food more relaxing than eating. I am not especially adept, but I do cook a lot. 

### Travel

Although I love to travel, the back and forth between Detroit and Krakow can be tiring, leaving less time to explore places I haven't visited yet. 

### Chess

Just started playing chess again. I don't win a lot, but I do enjoy the game.

## Open Office Hours

Feel free to [book 15 minutes with me](https://fantastical.app/sprytna/open-office). Invitation is open to anyone, although I only speak English.
