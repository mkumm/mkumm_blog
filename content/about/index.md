## TL;DR;

I was born in suburb of Detroit and am living in Krakow, Poland. I work as an Elixir Developer
for Simplebet. I have family (and a house) in Detroit, so I travel back often. 

## Work

I love my job working as an Elixir Developer at [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.io). I work with
amazing people in a technology stack I love and I am still trying to master. 

In prior iterations of my career
I have worked in leadership (CTO, Operations Management, IT Director, Development Manager). I have been 
coding since before I graduated 
high school and I find something interesting in most languages I study! 
Professionally I have developed in C, PHP, Python, and Elixir with most of the web
technologies that complement the languages. These days I look for inspiration in Rust, Haskell, Ocaml,
Go, Gleam, and others.

I have also been responsible for design projects and have come to enjoy the Adobe suite of products. 

## Hobbies and Interests

### Photography
I am a hobbiest photographer, mostly using my Nikon z50 (a wonderful hobbiest camera great for portability).

### Music Creation
I take a stab at some music creation with Ableton and played the violin through my first year of college.
Here is my latest sample, one of the birds

### Reading

I love reading
fiction, non-fiction, and technical books. I get all my news from The Economist. 

### Craft Beers
I love trying different beers and I get 
especially excited with cask ales. 

### Coffee
I love brewing coffee and always seek out the best local roasters (there are some great
ones in Krakow). 

### Polish Language
I continue to struggle to learn Polish, but I take weekly lessons and study most days of the week. 

### Cooking
I enjoy cooking
and find it more relaxing than watching TV. 

### Travel 
My partner and I do a lot of walking, at home and while traveling. 

### Chess
I have just started playing 
chess again. I don't win a lot, but I do enjoy the game.
