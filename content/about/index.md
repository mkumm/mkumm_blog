## TL;DR;

I was born in suburb of Detroit and I am now living in Krakow, Poland. I work as an Elixir Developer
for Simplebet. I have family (and a house) in Detroit, so I travel back often.

## Work

I love my job working as an Elixir Developer at [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.io). I work with
amazing people in a technology stack I love and I am still trying to master.

In prior iterations of my career
I have worked in leadership (CTO, Operations Management, IT Director, Development Manager). I have been
coding since before I graduated
high school and I find something interesting in most languages I study!
Professionally I have developed in C, PHP, Python, and Elixir with most of the web
technologies that complement the languages. These days I look for inspiration in Rust, Haskell, Ocaml,
Go, Gleam, and others.

I have also been responsible for design projects and have come to enjoy the Adobe suite of products.

## Hobbies and Interests

### Photography

I an amateur photographer and share some of my photos on [Instagram (@mkumm)](https://www.instagram.com/mkumm/)
and [Flickr.com (@mkumm)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkumm/). My main camera is my portable [Nikon z50](https://imaging.nikon.com/imaging/lineup/mirrorless/z_50/)
a really excellent camera for price.

### Music Creation

I take a stab at some music creation with Ableton and played the violin through my first year of college.
Here is my latest sample.

### Software Development

Code has been with me since an early age and I have never strayed too far away. I spend a lot of my time
in functional languages and compilers.

### Reading

I love reading
fiction, non-fiction, and technical books. I get all my news from The Economist.

### Craft Beers

I love trying different beers and I get
especially excited with cask ales.

### Coffee

I love brewing coffee and always seek out the best local roasters (there are some great
ones in Krakow).

### Polish Language

I continue to struggle to learn Polish, but I take weekly lessons and study most days of the week.

### Cooking

I enjoy cooking
and find it more relaxing than watching TV.

### Travel

My partner and I do a lot of walking, at home and while traveling.

### Chess

I have just started playing
chess again. I don't win a lot, but I do enjoy the game.
