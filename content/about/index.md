## tl;dr (too long; didn't read)

I was born in a suburb of Detroit and I am now living in Krakow, Poland. I work as an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) Developer for [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.ai/). I have family, friends, and a house in the Detroit area so I travel back often.

## Current Work

Working at [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.ai/) lets me work in Elixir for a company that supplies data to sports books; two things I really love! I work with an amazingly supportive team with some of the brightest in the Elixir community. We work mainly in Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView, and [Surface](https://surface-ui.org/).

## Previous Work

My professional career has followed two simultaneous paths. One in technology and the other in business management and leadership and sometimes overlapping.

Professionally I have been lucky enough to develop in C, PHP, Python, and Elixir. These days I play around in Lua, Rust, OCaml,
Go, (maybe soon Gleam), and others as well as the technologies supporting the current wave of AI soup.

In the past I have had several leadership roles with titles like CTO, Operations Management, IT Director, Development Manager. I really enjoyed those roles at the "problem solving and strategy" level.

## Hobbies and Interests

### Photography

I am a (very) amateur photographer. I share some of my photos on [Instagram (@mkumm)](https://www.instagram.com/mkumm/)
and [Flickr.com (@mkumm)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkumm/) and all the photos on this site were taken by me. My main camera is my wonderfully portable [Nikon z50](https://imaging.nikon.com/imaging/lineup/mirrorless/z_50/). I know it falls in the "non-professional" category of photo hardware, but I am, well a non-professional.

### Music Creation

I played violin through my first year of college and then just stopped. I did nothing with music for about 30 years and then I started playing around with Ableton. I have been experimenting with music composition as I find time, here is a short sample of my latest - **One of the Birds**

### Software Development

I grew up near the dawn of personal computers. Although I took BASIC classes in high school and Pascal and Fortran in college, I didn't really start developing at scale until I finally had my own personal computer, around 1995. I am very fortunate now that I get to develop software during work hours and then go deep into compilers (or whatever other topic I am interested in at the time) during my non-work hours. I just don't get tired of development.

### Reading

I love reading!

Fiction, non-fiction, technical books, whatever. At least 90% of my news comes from reading The Economist.

### Craft Beers

I love tasting craft beers even if my tolerance for drinking is dropping with age. I am not above taking a long trip primarily to taste some new (or old) regional beers.

### Coffee

I love brewing coffee (maybe even more than drinking it) and I always seek out the best local roasters (there are some great ones in Krakow).

### Polish Language

I continue to struggle to learn Polish, but I take weekly lessons and study most days of the week with my Polish-speaking partner.

### Cooking

I really enjoy cooking and end up cooking the vast majority of meals we eat. I will be sharing some of my favorite go-to recipes here.

### Travel

I have been traveling a little less lately. We have some bigger trips planned later this year to some places that I have been meaning to visit but haven't yet. Most places in Europe are pretty accessible and we sometimes see incredible deals like $25 round trip airfare tickets to Norway!

### Chess

I have just started playing chess again. I don't win a lot, but I do enjoy the game.

## Tools

The following are my current tools of choice to support my work and hobbies.

### Hardware

- **MacBook Pro M1 16-inch (work)** My work supplied laptop.
- **MacBook Pro M1 16-inch (personal)** My dedicated personal laptop.
- **MacBook Air M3 13-inch** I LOVE the sive, battery and power of this thing. The perfect companion for remote work and travel.
- **Philips 27-inch PHL 276E8V** A super affordable second display.
- **Benq ScreenBar** One of the my best purchases. Not only providing spot lighting only where I want it, it also somehow helps reduce my eye strain.
- **iPhone 13 ProMax** More than 2 years old and still works great for my purposes.
- **Nikkon z50** a really great camera body for walking around all day and taking photos. I have 2 lenses, the **Nikkor DX 16-50 3.5-6.3** and the **Nikkor DX 24/1.7**

### Development Software

- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) - My all day text editor.
- [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) - An opinionated and loaded version of NVIM.
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) - My terminal of choice at the moment. I am experimenting with it, it feel like it might be trying to do too much though.
- [Adobe Products](https://www.adobe.com/) - I know they are expensive, but they have been my graphics/layout workhorse for decades. It takes time to switch. I am trying the Affinity lineup though.
- [X-Scope](https://xscopeapp.com/) - A great companion for front-end web development
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/) - My PostgreSQL helper.
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - A necessary tool these days for development.
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - My calendar of choice, and you also get [CardHop](https://flexibits.com/cardhop) with your subscription.
- [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) - I only know about 2% of this application and it is still a blast to create music.
- [Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/) - All of my other digital sound tools.
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - I have been obsessed with task management for decades. Things has really nailed it.
