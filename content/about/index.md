## TL;DR;

I was born in a suburb of Detroit and I am now living in Krakow, Poland. I work as an Elixir Developer for Simplebet. I have family (and a house) in Detroit, so I travel back often.

## Work

I love my work as an Elixir Developer at [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.io). I work with amazong people, some of the brightest
in the Elixir community! I love the gaming industry and Elixir is easily my favorite language to code in. 

Professionally I have been lucky enough to create in C, PHP, Python, and Elixir with most of the web
technologies that complement the languages. These days I play around in Rust, Haskell, Ocaml,
Go, Gleam, and others as well as the technologies supporting the current wave of AI.

In the past I have had several leadership roles (CTO, Operations Management, IT Director, Development Manager) and have enjoyed
all my jobs for different reasons but generally I prefer coding. 

## Hobbies and Interests

### Photography

I an amateur photographer and share some of my photos on [Instagram (@mkumm)](https://www.instagram.com/mkumm/)
and [Flickr.com (@mkumm)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkumm/). My main camera is my portable [Nikon z50](https://imaging.nikon.com/imaging/lineup/mirrorless/z_50/)
a really excellent camera for price.

### Music Creation

I take a stab at some music creation with Ableton and played the violin through my first year of college.
Here is my latest sample.

### Software Development

Code has been with me since an early age and I have never strayed too far away. I spend a lot of my time
in functional languages and compilers.

### Reading

I love reading
fiction, non-fiction, and technical books. I get all my news from The Economist.

### Craft Beers

I love trying different beers and I get
especially excited with cask ales.

### Coffee

I love brewing coffee and always seek out the best local roasters (there are some great
ones in Krakow).

### Polish Language

I continue to struggle to learn Polish, but I take weekly lessons and study most days of the week.

### Cooking

I enjoy cooking
and find it more relaxing than watching TV.

### Travel

My partner and I do a lot of walking, at home and while traveling.

### Chess

I have just started playing
chess again. I don't win a lot, but I do enjoy the game.

## Tools

The following are my current tool choices to support my work and hobbies.

### Hardware

- **Macbook Pro M1 16-inch** My work supplied laptop.
- **Macbook Pro M1 16-inch** My dedicated personal laptop.
- **Macbook Air M3 13-inch** The perfect companion for remote work and travel. 
- **Philips 27-inch PHL 276E8V** A super affordable second display.
- **Benq ScreenBar** One of the my best purchases. Not only providing spot lighting only where I want it, it also helps reduce eye strain (for reasons I don't understand).
- **iPhone 13 ProMax** More tha 2 years old and still works great for my purposes.
- **Nikon z50** a really great camera body for walking around all day and taking photos. I have 2 lenses, the **Nikkor DX 16-50 3.5-6.3** and the **NIKKOR DX 24/1.7** 




My main workhorse is a Macbook Pro M1. I have a dedicated machine each for work and personal. I also have a portable
Macbook air 13 inch travel and "change of scenery" moments.
