## My Shave

A year ago I started to see adds in my social media feeds for a single-blade razor that looked pretty good, but the price sounded high. Found this little gem for about 1/3 of the price of the advertised blade on Amazon [Merkur Mk34c Razor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002A8JO1Q) and I love it.

I really enjoy the feeling of shaving with a single blade again. You start to understand why they used to call shaving a "scrape" - in a good way. For blades I use [Astra blades](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QY8QXM) which run about 8 cents each.
