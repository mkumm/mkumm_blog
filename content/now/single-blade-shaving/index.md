## Context

I think everyone understands that 5-blade razors and the prices they are charge are pretty silly. After getting bombarded by social media adds for a simple (but expensive) single-blade razor, I started to look around. Found this little gem for about 1/3 of the price on Amazon [Merkur Mk34c Razor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002A8JO1Q)

## 1 Year Later

Still using my razor six times a week and still enjoy shaving with it. Hard to identify what is so satisfying about it, but I can honestly say I enjoy my morning shave again. 

By the way, these blades ([Astra blades](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QY8QXM) ) are less than $10 for a 100. Not even close to running out yet.
