:poland: Updated March 1, 2024 from Poland!

## Still Working at Simplebet!

Stories of my unemployment have been greatly exaggerated. I reposted a LinkedIn story about a coworker who is currenlty open for work and somehow that ended up being attributed to me in feeds. Even some close friends thought I was unemployed! :see_no_evil:

## Nauka jÄ™zyka polskiego

I am finally learning speak Polish. Progress is slow, but progress is steady and I am really enjoying it. If you are also interested in learning Polish I recommend reaching out to [Glossa](https://e-polish.eu/polish-for-foreigners). They can help people in any geogrophy to learn Polish. Thank you [Magdalena](https://e-polish.eu/en/polish_teachers_online/magdalena_wygladacz)!

## Current Hobbies

### Chess

Thanks to 'Chicago Mike' I am finally really getting into chess. I am learning on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com) and play (losing) matches on [lichess](https://lichess.org/) - feel free to request a game! I'm _'mrkumm'_ on both platforms.

### Music Creation

I am having a blast creating music on [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) and I am just about to pull the trigger on their [Push](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) product, mostly for Simpler/Samples playback. And my favorite supporting audio tools are from [Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/), especially [loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/).
