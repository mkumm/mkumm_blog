:poland: Updated April 13, 2024 from Poland!

## Still Working at Simplebet!

Stories of my unemployment have been greatly exaggerated. I reposted a LinkedIn story about a coworker who is currenlty open for work and somehow that ended up being attributed to me in people's feeds. Even some of my close friends thought I was unemployed! :see_no_evil:

## Nauka jÄ™zyka polskiego

I am finally learning to speak Polish. Progress is slow, but steady and I am finally really enjoying it. If you are also interested in learning Polish, I recommend reaching out to [Glossa](https://e-polish.eu/polish-for-foreigners). They can help people in any geogrophy to learn Polish. A special thank you to [Magdalena](https://e-polish.eu/en/polish_teachers_online/magdalena_wygladacz)!

## Current Hobbies

### Chess

Thanks to 'Chicago Mike' I am really starting to enjoy chess. I am learning on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com) and play (losing) matches on [lichess](https://lichess.org/) - feel free to request a game! I'm _'mrkumm'_ on both platforms.

### Music Creation

I am having a blast creating music on [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/), I just wish I had more time to create. I also rely on tools from [Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/), especially [loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/).

## Currently Studying/Reading

### Strange Loops

I am working through [I Am A Strange Loop](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter-ebook/dp/B004PYDBS0/) with a couple of friends. I got through about 1/2 the book about 10 years ago and have been meaning to read it through for a while. I am really looking forward to the converations that will come from reading this book with some friends.

### Compilers

I was intimidated to start "The Dragon Book" [Compilers: Principles, Techniques, & Tools](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Alfred-Aho-ebook/dp/B009TGD06W) but now that I have, I LOVE it. It is hard, but so incredibly well written. It is a joy to read, even if takes some additional concentrated effort to work through.

### Books I am reading now

- [Read Write Own](https://www.amazon.com/Read-Write-Own-Building-Internet-ebook/dp/B0C8FNFV38). I'm a believer
- [Cursed Bunny](https://www.amazon.com/Cursed-Bunny-Bora-Chung-ebook/dp/B0CLL1MSS1) Uncomfortable fiction, but it's fun to read and the stories stay with you.
- [Hidden Potential](https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Potential-Science-Achieving-Greater-ebook/dp/B0C5LN1BCM) My first Adam Grant book. Enjoying it, but at 25% of the way in I am still waiting for the grand reveal.
- [Engineering Elixir Applications](https://pragprog.com/titles/beamops/engineering-elixir-applications/) I am only 3 chapters in, but wow this is a fun book! Exceedingly easy to code along with the author. I am garbage at DevOps, this book may help!
