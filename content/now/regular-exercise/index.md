## Problem

My energy level was getting really bad and I was having trouble making it through the day. By Saturday I barely had enough energy to enjoy even a small part of the weekend. I decided I needed to see if there was something I could do.

## Decision

I time-boxed 6 weeks to make improving my energy level my highest priority. After getting blood work and not seeing anything obvious, I started reading and experimenting. I won't share everything, but I "discovered" what most people already know.

## What's Working

Exercise and a change to my eating habits. 
- 4 days a week I walk to my gym before my morning coffee
   - ride the bike 20 minutes
   - 10 minutes on the treadmill
   - little lifting. 
- 3 days a week I walk at least 30 minutes.
- Eating on a normal schedule (9:30, 12:30, 3:30, 6:30)
- Big reduction in sugar and highly-processed foods
- Taught myself "taking a break" does not mean "eat junk food"

## Results

In the three weeks that I have been exercising my energy is back to where it was several years ago. I have [Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/) to thank (podcast and book) to encourage me to just start where I am and make sure that I keep a sustainable schedule and effort level. Increase effort when I am ready. I haven't lost any kilograms yet, but my clothes fit better which is a great bonus.
