## Problem

My energy levels were getting so bad I was having trouble making it through the day without a nap. By Saturday I barely had enough energy to enjoy part of the weekend.

## Decision

I decided I had to do something. I time-boxed 6 weeks to make raising my energy levels my highest priority. Higher than my work, other commitments everything. After getting blood work and not seeing anything obvious that would affect my energy, I tried a few things. What worked best for me was good old exercise. I have a gym less than a 10 minute walk and so I signed up pretty much sight unseen just because of how close it was (and pretty cheap). 

## What I am Doing

4 days a week I walk to my gym before our morning coffee and ride the bike 20 minutes, 10 minutes on the treadmill and a little lifting. 3 days a week I walk at least 30 minutes and 1 day off. 

I tend to cook most of my meals, so that wasn't difficult but I did cut out most of the snacking and keep sugary and highly-processed foods down maybe 90% from where I was. 

## Results

In the three weeks that I have been exercising my energy is back to where it was several years ago. I have Peter Attia to thank (from his podcast and book) to encourage me to just start where I am and make sure that I keep a sustainable, but improving pace. 

My clothes are fitting better as well.
