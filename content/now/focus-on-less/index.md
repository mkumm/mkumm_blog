## Context

I came across a Field Notes notebook from 2 years ago that contained a well thought out list of what was critically important to accomplish during the next year. I remember writing the list and thinking there was a lot on this list that needed to get done and perhaps I should trim it a little. I couldn't find a single thing (of the 20 items) on the list that was not critical to complete.

I think you can guess that virtually everything on that list was still on my list this year. I had dabbled with every single items and completed almost nothing

## Learning

[Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/) helped me articulate things that I felt but didn't really know how to act on. I have been reading his books and taking his advice like a doctor handing me scripts. 

## Results

For the last 12 weeks I have set a key priority for each 6 week block. In that time I look to either accomplish something important of develop a new habit that will help sustain me when I will be focusing on the next thing. With the new mindset in place I find myself staying with projects until they are complete and not picking up projects that I don't feel I can take to a good stopping point. Suprisingly, I find this mindset carries over into my daily work, staying with hard problems much longer than I used to.  

Maybe check out Cal's new book [Slow Productivity](https://calnewport.com/slow/).
