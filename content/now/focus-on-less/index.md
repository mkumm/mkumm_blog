## Context

A few months after writing my annual plan, all the things I HAVE TO get done for the year, I happened on one of my older notebooks from 3 years prior. I looked through and to my disappointment found my 3-years-old annual plan was about the same as the one I just write this year. 

I learned the hard way how difficult it is to make progress on our most important goals without focused effort.

## I Am Learning

[Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/) helped me articulate things that I felt but didn't really know how to act on. I have been reading his books and taking his advice with a good result. 

## Results

I am learning to do more over time, I need to focus on and work on less in the present. Of course I am early in this new process but I am encouraged. I have already completed 2 things that were on my list 3 years ago.  

Maybe check out Cal's new book [Slow Productivity](https://calnewport.com/slow/).
