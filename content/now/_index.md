:poland: Updated August 10, 2024 from Poland!

## Open Office Hours

Feel free to [book 15 minutes with me](https://fantastical.app/sprytna/open-office). Invitation is open to anyone, although I only speak English. 

## Working at Simplebet!

Working at [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.ai/) lets me code in **Elixir** for a company that supplies data to **Sports Books**; two things I really love! I also get to with amazingly supportive people; some of the brightest in the Elixir community.

## Living in Poland

I have been living in Krakow, Poland for nearly 3 years and I really love it. We have a very modest apartment but the location is excellent. We are few hundred yards away from a beer garden, my gym, a farmer's market, 2 regular markets and a tram stop. From the tram we can be in the city center in 20 minutes. Not to mention most of Europe is less than a 2 hour flight away with round trip prices often under $100.

## Nauka jÄ™zyka polskiego (Learning Polish)

I am finally learning to speak Polish. Progress is slow, but I am finally really enjoying it. If you are also interested in learning Polish I recommend reaching out to [Glossa](https://e-polish.eu/polish-for-foreigners). They can help people in any geography to learn Polish. A special thank you to [Magdalena](https://e-polish.eu/en/polish_teachers_online/magdalena_wygladacz)!

## Meditation Practice

I have been practicing meditation semi-regularly for the last 10 years. I am currently rebooting (maybe we can call it "beginner's mind?") my practice using [The Way App](https://www.thewayapp.com/) from Henry Shukman after listening to an [interview with Kevin Rose](https://www.kevinrose.com/the-mysteriousunsolvable-zen-koans-henry-shukman-associate-master-of-sanbo-zen/). If you are new, or feeling a little stuck with your meditation practice, maybe give this one a try.

## Current Hobbies

### Chess

Thanks to 'Chicago Mike' I am really starting to enjoy chess. I am learning on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com) and play (losing) matches on [lichess](https://lichess.org/) - feel free to [request a game](https://lichess.org/@/mrkumm)! I'm _'mrkumm'_ on both platforms.

### Music Creation

I am having a blast creating music on [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/), I just wish I had more time to create. I also rely on tools from [Rogue Amoeba](https://rogueamoeba.com/), especially [loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/).
