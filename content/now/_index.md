:poland: Updated August 10, 2024 from Poland!

## Open Office Hours

Feel free to [book 15 minutes with me](https://fantastical.app/sprytna/open-office). Invitation is open to anyone, although I only speak English. 

## Working at Simplebet!

Working at [Simplebet](https://www.simplebet.ai/) lets me code in **Elixir** for a company that supplies data to **Sports Books**; two things I really love! I also get to with amazingly supportive people; some of the brightest in the Elixir community.

## Living in Poland

I have been living in Krakow, Poland for nearly 3 years and I really love it. We have a very modest apartment but the location is excellent. We are few hundred yards away from a beer garden, my gym, a farmer's market, 2 regular markets and a tram stop. From the tram we can be in the city center in 20 minutes. Not to mention most of Europe is less than a 2 hour flight away with round trip prices often under $100.

## Nauka jÄ™zyka polskiego (Learning Polish)

I am finally learning to speak Polish. Progress is slow, but I am finally really enjoying it. If you are also interested in learning Polish I recommend reaching out to [Glossa](https://e-polish.eu/polish-for-foreigners). They can help people in any geography to learn Polish. A special thank you to [Magdalena](https://e-polish.eu/en/polish_teachers_online/magdalena_wygladacz)!
