## About

This is my version from watching [Gordon Ramsay prepare this dish on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP6E3JtmsCE).

I have made this dish several times, and each time the taste has been different. Try experimenting with the levels of spice and quantity of wine (or none at all).

## Ingredients

- 5 fresh Polish sausages
- 1 medium red onion
- 1 medium red pepper
- 3 cloves of garlic
- Olive oil (enough to coat your dutch oven)
- 1/3 cup of dry white wine
- 1 1/2 cups of white basmati rice (washed)
- 3 cups of chicken stock
- 1 green opnion 
- 1/4 cup of parslay
- Salt, Pepper, Hungarian Smoked Paprika

## Directions

### Prep
- Remove the skins from the sausage and "crumble" the meat.
- Rough cut the onion and the Red Pepper, but keep separate.
- Dice 3 cloves of garlic.
- Wash the rice to remove most of the starch.

### Cooking
- Slowely bring up the temperature of your pan.
- Add enough olive oil to coat the bottom.
- Add onions and cook on low temperature for about 5 minutes. Salt as desired.
- Add red pepper, cook for a few minutes.
- Add garlic and cook for about a minute.
- Bring temperature of the pan up to prepare for sausage.
- Clear some room in the pan and add the sausage. 
    - Cook look enough to render out some of the fat.
- Add Smoked Paprika and cook for about a minute
- Add rice and cook for about a minute.
- Deglaze the pan with the white wine.
- Add the stock and bring to boil. 
- Once boiling, bring the temperature down to a simmer.
- Let simmer for about 15 minutes with the top off. Stiff occaisonally.  
- Rice should taste mostly done (if not, cook an additional 5 minutes with the top on)
- Once rice is done, add parslay and green onion and mix. 

Food is ready to be served!
