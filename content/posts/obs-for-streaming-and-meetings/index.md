I wanted to add some advanced media features for zoom meetings, like drawing on the screen, and changing scenes for live coding. And of course there will be a video at the end.

## Motivation

I love watching someone like [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen) do his thing on YouTube or live streaming. Not that I want to be _like him_. I did want my screen to be like his though. A screen that could bring up an editor, draw freehand over whatever he was talking about, or seemlessly add applications to the window. It took me some experimeting but I think I came up with a pretty good set of tools and configurations that works for me.
