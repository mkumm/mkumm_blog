The tools we choose have a big impact on our quality of life. Zed is my editing tool of choice (at the moment).

## Plain Text

Before I start, if you haven't watched [Dylan Beattie](https://dylanbeattie.net/) [Presentation on Plain Text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRxIgu9R70), go check it out - it is fantastic!

For the most part, us developers have to create, edit, manipulate, delete lots and lot of text. This may not actually be the most time consuming part of our jobs, but it is significant. What tool(s) we choose to do this kind of work matters a lot. It matters a lot to the joy we get working.

When I was writing my first BASIC programs in high school, I don't remember having a choice on the editor I was using. I typed on some non-descript text file and my program would run. Of course in those days if I hit 100 lines I was complaining about the amount of work I had to do.

In college I worked on the university's VAX machine and we would type 'EDIT' and then we could edit files. I think the editor technically was EVE.

I struggled on this way for about a decade, where certain programming environments had their editor, some didin't but they all felt about the same.

## Remember MS FrontPage?
It was about 1994 that I finally had access to a _real_ personal computer and was starting to learn tagged languages, including HTML. HotMetal was like nothing I ever saw before. It had helpers, different views, macro buttons. it wasn't long after I remember seeing ads for Microsoft FrontPage. I could not wait! Me and some friends were driving back from vacation and I asked them to stop off at the Mall so I could spend the last of my money and purchase this productivy miracle.

It was total and complete rubish. It held all the promise in the world to make it easier and faster to develop website, but I couldn't even get navigation to work.

In a few years the world was about to get much much better.

## Dreamweaver
Macromedia Dreamweaver was truly fantiastic. A wonderful fast and responsive editor with a quick preview mode. Rendering was outstanding with many customisations to for your environments.
