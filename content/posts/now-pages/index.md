How do we stay updated with friends and family, especially as we get older?
{{</lead>}}

## Problem Statement

I want to be able to stay updated on the happenings of my friends and family (and their children, etc) and give my friends and family access to what I have been up to in as non-intrusive was as possible.

## The Landscape

We have Facebook, Twitter, Mastedon, family email lists, personal websites, instant messages, and I am sure I am failing to list another 100 or so.
