## Cześć, Hello from Poland

I feel a bit like Doc Brown from Back to the Future explaining to Marty that he
has been alive and living happily for these many years. I too am alive and have
been living happily these many years in Krakow, Poland! Although I had been
traveling often to Poland over the course of many years, I decided to apply for
my residency in Poland in 2022. I still have many ties (and a house) back in the
United States, so I still travel back often for visits. 

## "What do you miss about living in the US?"

Outside of family and friends, there wasn't much I really
missed. At this point I don't even have a "can't wait to..." list when I travel
back. I did have a few surprises like: 
- I can't watch Columbo or Arrested Development on my US-based streaming service. 
- American pizza is a thing, and you really can't buy it here.
- Classic long bars found in most pubs in the US are rare. 
- No Apple Stores in Poland.
- Amazon is NOT the primary place to shop online. 

Nothing from the above list is a big deal to me. Not speaking the native
language is still a sore spot for me, but I am making progress; just not as
quick as I would like.
