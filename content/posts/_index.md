# Blog

<div class="text-sm italic">
"Do people still read blog's?" This was the first question my daughter asked me when she found out I invested time in creating a (another) blog. I think long-form content is still important, especially for topics of consequence.

This blog has three main categories. Development, Life (Food, Krakow, etc), and Business. Most of what I write here is used as content that I would send in an email based on questions I get.

I hope you enjoy. Always feel free to send me feedback either via [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkumm) or email me at [mike @ mkumm.com](mailto:mike@mkumm.com)
