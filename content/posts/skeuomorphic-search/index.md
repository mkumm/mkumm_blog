Why do we search for actual movie titles in Netflix, and other examples of Skeumorphic Search

## Make Technology Great Again

For most technologies to move forward they need some jumping point. A shared understanding is a good place to start, but a losely place to stay. And stay we have for so many things. 

## Search for Example

Search is painfully stuck in the past. When we want to watch a movie on Netflix, we do essentially the same thing we did when we had piles of DVDs (or even VHSs). Our mind tries to come up with the title of the movie we want to watch, and then if we could check our alphabetized stock pile of movies and eventually find the movie. In some cases, especially when we were not as organized as we could be, we might remember the color of the box, or the last place we used it as a coaster. But in our physical world, that is about the best we could hope for [wish I could insert a fun Rube Goldberg machine video here].

If we abstract the previous example just a little bit, we have a large group of things and we want to find a singular item in that group. In some cases we want to find that item by a name, but if we don't remember the name (the ID) we get creative and try to remember some other tidbit like color or location (meta data).

We pretty much do the same on Netflix. In some part of our brain we think of everything available to stream as "our stockpile of movies" and we try to find movies we want to watch by entering the name of the movie, if we remeber it, or some meta-data, like actor name to get closer. It's the same concept. Look for a movie by name (id) or some related thing (meta-data) to watch our movie. 

## AI (But not yet)

AI is helping us pull out of our search history of the past.
